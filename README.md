# Spork ðŸŽ§

**this project has been updated to a new version, you can find it [here](https://github.com/simone98dm/sporky)**

## How to use it

On the webpage just login into with your Spotify account, then authorize the app to get access to your account info (no worries, then you can revoke the access, is just needed to get only the top listened tranks).

## Run locally

```bash
$ npm install

(update the client id and secret)

$ npm run dev
```

The web app should be available on port `3000`
